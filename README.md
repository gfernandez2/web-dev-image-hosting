An app to upload any image you want and get a shareable link to send to your
friends. Will work similarly to Imgur.

# Running the Dev Server

Simply run `npm start`. If you are missing dependencies, make sure you run
`npm i` as well.

# Environment Variables
To run the program, you need to make sure you set the correct environment
variables. The easiest way to do this is to create a `.env` file. We've
provided a `.template.env` to give you an idea on what needs to be set. Simply
replace the `<YOUR_VALUE_HERE>` sections with the correct API keys.
